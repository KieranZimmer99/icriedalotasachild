                <h2>So how did we get here?</h2>
                <p>Oh hey! Didn’t see you there. My name’s Kieran, and today I’m excited to tell you a little bit about something I hold near and dear: myself. I’m 20 years old (21 in October) and I’m from a nice little beach town called Encinitas, a little north of San Diego. Right now, I go to school to study English at UC Berkeley. When I was little, I was obsessed with science fiction and fantasy novels, enough that now I pay to go to school and read them. </p>
                
                <p>Something else you should know is that I’m a huge sucker for the outdoors. Over the last few summers, my friends and our dads chipped away at the John Muir Trail. That picture of me is from almost a year ago today, before we finished our hike by packing down into Yoesemite. </p>

                    <p>Don't like reading? Or maybe you're a podcast enthusiast? Say no more; you can listen to an interview right below this sentence, and you'll get to hear me chatting with my mom about, you guessed it: me. </p>

                <p>I also love playing and recording music. When I was 9, my parents signed me up for guitar lessons at our local YMCA. I ended up loving it, and after taking lessons for a couple of years, it really stuck with me. Along the way, I also started playing bass guitar, and I’m currently working on my singing. If you click that link right there, you can take a listen to a song I wrote recently for my solo project, Norf Rossmore. </p>

                <p>Something else I love is skateboarding! I remember seeing the show Rocket Power on Nickelodeon when I was in kindergarten or so, and wanted a skateboard more than anything. Truth be told I cared more about the coolness factor than the opportunity to have fun, but nonetheless I eventually got a board from Target and I was hooked. Last summer, my friends and I back home commandeered an old film camera to record ourselves and make some homie edits. Even when I'm by myself, I still try to get out and film, which you can see in that video below where I expand on what I like about skating a little more.</p>

         <p>Well, that just about does it! I hope you picked up some nice factoids about me today. If you didn't, that's okay too. Don't sweat it. Don't forget to wear a mask!</p>
